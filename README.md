# enterCode

This is a small toy for my children:
- they want a small keyboard to "simulate" a code to enter their room
- a green LED will light on when the code is correct (red if not)
- they will also be able to use a RFID key

It will be powered by two AA battery, and should not consume (sleep mode)
